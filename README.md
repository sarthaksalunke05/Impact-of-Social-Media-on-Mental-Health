Project Description
Impact of Social Media on Mental Health

 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the impact of social media usage on the mental health and behavioral patterns of students using Power BI. With the increasing dependence on digital platforms, understanding how screen time, platform preference, and usage intensity affect mental well-being has become critical. The objective of this project is to transform raw social media usage data into meaningful insights that help identify addiction risk levels, usage behavior trends, and mental health outcomes.

 Objective of the Project

The primary objectives of this project are:

To analyze average daily social media usage among students.

To classify users into Healthy, Moderate, and High Usage Risk categories.

To evaluate the relationship between screen time and mental health scores.

To identify platforms contributing most to excessive usage.

To provide an interactive and user-friendly dashboard for data-driven decision-making.

 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains student-level information related to social media behavior and mental health indicators. Key attributes include:

Demographic details such as Age, Gender, Country, and Relationship Status.

Social media usage metrics including Daily Usage Hours, Platform Used, and Addiction Score.

Mental health indicators such as Mental Health Score and Sleep Hours.

Calculated fields for Usage Risk Level and High Addiction Classification.

The data was cleaned, transformed, and modeled within Power BI to ensure accuracy and consistency.

 Data Modeling & Transformation

Data cleaning was performed using Power Query, including handling null values and standardizing categorical fields.

Relationships were established between tables to enable cross-filtering and drill-down analysis.

Calculated columns and DAX measures were created to derive metrics such as average daily usage, total students, high addiction count, and mental health averages.

 Key Metrics & KPIs

The dashboard highlights critical KPIs to provide a quick snapshot of user behavior:

Average Age of Users

Average Daily Social Media Usage (Hours)

Average Mental Health Score

Total Number of Students

High Addiction Students Count

Overall Usage Risk Level

These KPIs help in identifying overall trends and high-risk indicators at a glance.

 Dashboard Visualizations

The dashboard uses multiple visual elements to deliver insights effectively:

Bar Charts to compare average daily usage across different usage risk levels.

Donut Charts to show the distribution of students by usage status.

Gauge Visual to represent average daily usage against a defined risk threshold.

Platform-wise Analysis using horizontal bar charts to identify the most used social media platforms.

Tabular View to display detailed student-level data.

Geographical Analysis to visualize country-wise distribution of social media usage.

Each visual is designed with consistent color coding to represent risk levels clearly.

 Interactivity & Filters

The dashboard is fully interactive and includes slicers for:

Gender

Relationship Status

Social Media Platform

Country

These filters allow users to dynamically explore the data and perform focused analysis based on specific demographics or behavioral segments.

 Key Insights Generated

Students with higher daily screen time tend to fall under Moderate to High Usage Risk categories.

Excessive usage is associated with lower mental health scores and reduced sleep hours.

Certain platforms contribute significantly more to daily screen time than others.

A large portion of users fall into the moderate usage category, indicating potential risk if usage increases further.

 Business & Social Impact

This project provides actionable insights that can be used by:

Educational institutions to identify at-risk students.

Mental health professionals to understand digital behavior trends.

Policy makers to promote digital well-being awareness.

Organizations aiming to encourage responsible social media usage.

 Tools & Technologies Used
